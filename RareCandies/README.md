## This is a game that I created in a group as a final project for a class. It uses a game engine that we created over the class period with a base of SDL2.

## The Game:

The game is a basic stealth based adventure game.
The player plays as a Proygon and tries to collect all the candies on the levels and reach the pokeball.
While moving through the 5 levels that are implemented and dodgeing the Gastlys and the Magnemites.

## Gastly's Behavior
The behavior tree is as described below:
